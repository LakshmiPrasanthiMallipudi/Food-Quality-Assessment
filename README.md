# Food-Quality-Assessment

#Problem Description

The food inspection department conducts regular inspection on food quality for various restaurants in the city. Itâ€™s a very well documented procedure and over time some good amount of data has been generated out of these inspections.

The inspection department would like to predict where they should focus most in terms of their next inspection schedule, so that they can most optimize their time at hand to catch the worst offenders. Can the past inspection or any data that they have collected predict which facility will pass or fail.
